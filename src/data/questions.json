With default retention, Delta keeps old files for 7 days, so deleted files can remain time-travel-accessible until a VACUUM run occurs *after* the retention window. If deletes happen Sunday 1am and VACUUM runs Monday 3am, that is only ~1 day later—so the deleted files are still within the default 7-day retention and won’t be physically removed yet; they would remain until a VACUUM run that happens after 7 days have elapsed (effectively about 8 days in this weekly cadence).\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect\nA: VACUUM does permanently remove eligible files, but eligibility is gated by the retention period; it is not “around 24 hours” by default.\nB: The default retention is not 24 hours; the question states default table settings, which imply the standard 7-day retention.\nC: Time travel is limited by retained history; it does not guarantee “always” recreatable data, and the question’s concern is addressed by retention + vacuum, not admin privileges.\nD: ACID guarantees do not mean immediate physical purge; deletes are logical until files are vacuumed after retention.\n\nKey takeaway\nWith default settings, deletes are logical; physical removal (and therefore time-travel inaccessibility) occurs only after the retention window and a subsequent VACUUM.",
